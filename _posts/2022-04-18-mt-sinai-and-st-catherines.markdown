Yesterday I took a guided trip out of Dahab to climb the Mt Sinai where Moses famously saw the burning bush, climbed to the top and received the 10 commandments. The rest is history. Interestingly the tour is an overnight one, starting at around 10pm, heading 2 1/2 hours out into the desert, part of the way in a convoy excorted by police, and then beginning about a 3 hour trek to the top in time for the sunrise at around 5:30am. This hiking through the early hours of the morning makes it quite tiring but also a bit of an adventure.

| No torch required. We were lucky to have a full moon help us out on the climb to the top. |
